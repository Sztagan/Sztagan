- **Docker**
- **SQL**
- **Linux**: Bash

## 🌟 Key Projects
- [LoanRepaymentBinaryPred](https://github.com/filki?tab=repositories): This project focuses on predicting loan repayment abilities using quantitative methods, statistical tests, and machine learning techniques. Key tools include Python, with libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`. The model applies algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to determine the probability of an individual repaying a loan. The project emphasizes data-driven insights over banking knowledge, showcasing a rigorous statistical validation process to ensure model accuracy.
- [Data-Analyst-Associate-Practical-Exam](https://github.com/filki/Data-Analyst-Associate-Practical-Exam): This project delves into pet supplies data to analyze market trends and consumer behavior. Utilizing Python within a Jupyter Notebook, it applies libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation, `numpy` for numerical data handling, and `matplotlib` for visualization. The analysis likely involves examining trends and patterns to provide actionable insights into pet supply sales.
